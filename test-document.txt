This is a test document for the Smart Document Finder application.

It contains multiple sentences. Each sentence should be processed correctly. The text chunking algorithm should break this content into smaller, manageable pieces.

This document will help us verify that the document processing pipeline works as expected. We can test text extraction and chunking functionality with this sample content.

The system should be able to identify this as a plain text file and extract all the content successfully.
